# The Composable Architecture (TCA)
In iOS eco-system, there are few architectural concepts -- MVVM, VIPER or [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) -- that are used to build mobile applications for Apples' devices.

Though, after observing [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)'s organic growth over few years now, it seems to solve many of the app development aspects - Modularisation, State Management, Uni-directional Data Flow, Composition of Features, Dependancy Management, Testing of flow, Value Systems, ergonomics and much more.
